## Onboarding Retry Behavior

The `onboard` command implements an infinite retry loop that continues attempting TO1 and TO2 protocols until successful or manually interrupted:

- **RV Bypass**: When an RV directive has `rv_bypass` enabled, the client skips TO1 and attempts TO2 directly to the Owner. The RV instruction must include the owner server's IP/DNS address, protocol, and device_port to successfully connect for TO2 and complete onboarding
- **Directive Iteration**: Client processes all RV directives sequentially. If one fails, it continues to the next directive
- **Delays**: Applies delays between retry attempts as specified in RV directives (with ±25% jitter per FDO spec)
- **TO2 Retry Delay**: Use `--to2-retry-delay` to add delay between multiple Owner URLs from the same directive (default: 0, disabled)

## Running the FDO Client using a Credential File Blob
### Remove Credential File
Remove the credential file if it exists:
```
rm cred.bin
```
### Run the FDO Client with DI server URL
Run the FDO client, specifying the DI URL, key type and credentials blob file (on linux systems, root is required to properly gather a device identifier):
```
./go-fdo-client device-init http://127.0.0.1:8038 --device-info gotest --key ec256 --debug --blob cred.bin
```

### Print FDO Client Configuration or Status
Print the FDO client configuration or status:
```
./go-fdo-client print --blob cred.bin
```

### Execute TO0 from FDO Go Server
TO0 will be completed in the respective Owner and RV.

### Run the FDO Client onboard command
Perform FDO client onboard. The supported key type and key exchange suite must always be explicitly configured through the --key and --kex flags:
```
./go-fdo-client onboard --key ec256 --kex ECDH256 --debug --blob cred.bin
```

### Optional: Run the FDO Client in RV-Only Mode
Run the FDO client in RV-only mode, which stops after TO1 is performed:
```
./go-fdo-client onboard --rv-only --key ec256 --kex ECDH256 --debug --blob cred.bin
```

## Running the FDO Client with a TPM device
>NOTE: fdo\_client may require elevated privileges to use the TPM device. Please use 'sudo' to execute the fdo\_client.

### Clear TPM NV Index to Delete Existing Credential

Ensure `tpm2_tools` is installed on your system.

**Clear TPM NV Index**

   Use the following command to clear the TPM NV index:

   ```sh
   sudo tpm2_nvundefine 0x01D10001
   ```
### Run the FDO Client device-init command with DI server URL
Run FDO client device-init, specifying the DI server URL with the TPM resource manager path specified.
The supported key type must always be explicitly configured through the --key flag:
```
./go-fdo-client device-init http://127.0.0.1:8038 --device-info gotest --key ec256 --tpm /dev/tpmrm0 --debug
```

### Print FDO Client Configuration or Status
Print the FDO client configuration or status:
```
./go-fdo-client print --tpm /dev/tpmrm0
```

### Execute TO0 from FDO Go Server
TO0 will be completed in the respective Owner and RV.

### Run the FDO Client onboard command
Perform FDO client onboard. The supported key type and key exchange suite must always be explicitly configured through the --key and --kex flags:
```
./go-fdo-client onboard --key ec256 --kex ECDH256 --tpm /dev/tpmrm0 --debug
```

### Optional: Run the FDO Client in RV-Only Mode
Run the FDO client in RV-only mode, which stops after TO1 is performed:
The supported key type and key exchange suite must always be explicitly configured through the --key and --kex flags:
```
./go-fdo-client onboard --rv-only --key ec256 --kex ECDH256 --tpm /dev/tpmrm0  --debug
```
